# TSP on GNN
A Graph Neural Network-based Guided Local Search system for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem on a real map of Greece.

This application:
✅ Generates a TSP graph from real Greek city locations  
✅ Trains a Graph Neural Network to predict **regret values** for edges  
✅ Builds a route using Guided Local Search with 3 optimization algorithms  
✅ Displays results on an interactive folium map in a PyQt5 GUI

---

## 🚀 Features
- Graphical UI with map of Greece
- Add cities manually or auto-generate 5, 10, 20, or 50 random cities
- Trainable GNN model for regret prediction
- Guided Local Search with:
  ✅ Greedy Nearest Neighbor (using regret, not distance)  
  ✅ Relocate algorithm  
  ✅ 2-opt local search on penalized edges  
- Compares GNN+GLS result vs classical TSP solver
- Visualization of the final best path
